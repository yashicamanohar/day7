In my project I create the Cab services web application which is the beginning level of cab booking Management system.

I use the aspx.net for the front end development and using css for styling, ado.net for connection between web server and databases, sql server for database.

My project contains the home page,  admin login, user login and about us.

Admin login with username and password which is already set in admin table.

In user login, user sign up their login details which is stored in userdetails table and password must be encrypted.

In home page, user see the car models , seat availability and booking forms.

In about us page contains details of the Cab services.

After sign up their details, user book the cab through booking form. After confirm the booking, it will store in booking_details, and admin see the details of booking from the admin page. 

To prevent the sql injection attack, I used the stored procedure for inserting and updating the tables.
